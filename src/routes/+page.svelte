  <h1>Welcome, Revenant</h1>
  <p>
    This is the concept page of a videogame. In this game, the player takes the
    place of a Revenant Mariner, a dedicated explorer sailing through a deadly
    ocean to discover new lands. It's meant to be a sort of Uncharted Waters
    clone, but without the manual tile-based navigation. The game's mechanics
    will be primarily focused on exploration and discovery, with a secondary
    focus on combat and trading.

  <h2>Aetherhaven</h2>

  <p>
    Aetherhaven, your home. Surrounded by a sea cloaked in perpetual mist, this
    city is a beacon of advanced magical technologies and towering multicolored
    skyscrapers. It pulses with the energy of arcing lightning and the hum of
    arcane innovations, attracting adventurers, scholars, and mystics from all
    corners of the world.
  </p>

  <h2>Drifter</h2>

  <p>
    The Drifter is a ship that the player uses to navigate the ocean. It's a
    small, cheap ship that the player will want to replace as soon as possible,
    but an upgraded ship will require more influence and crew to maintain.

  <h2>Revenant Mariner</h2>

  <p>
    You, the player. The Revenant Mariner navigates this world with the aid of a
    Revenant's Mark, a powerful magical tattoo that transports the wearer back
    in time any time they die. Revenant Mariners chart and navigate The Lost
    Haze by repeatedly dying and returning to the past. When the tattoo is
    activated, the tattoo is updated with the cause of the Revenant's death, as
    well as the last known direction the Revenant had set off in, and an updated
    count of the number of times the tattoo has triggered.
  </p>

  <h2>The Lost Haze</h2>
  <img
    src="/lost-haze.webp"
    alt="A vast and deadly ocean filled with monsters and storms"
  />
  <p>
    The Lost Haze is a vast and deadly ocean filled with monsters, storms, and
    other dangers. Though it may seem like an ordinary mist-filled ocean at
    first, The Revenant Mariner must navigate this ocean to discover new lands
    and treasures, but the ocean is filled with dangers that can easily kill the
    Revenant Mariner. The Lost Haze is a gently sloping hyperbolic plane, with
    islands of stability and safety scattered throughout the ocean. The ocean is
    filled with monsters, storms, and other dangers that the Revenant Mariner
    must navigate to reach their destination.
  </p>

  <h2>Gameplay</h2>
  <p>
    The Revenant Mariner navigates the ocean by charting a predetermined course
    and seeing where it leads. In practice, this will essentially be implemented
    as an idle game, where the Revenant Mariner sets a general direction, and
    the game fast-forwards through a series of possible courses, telling the
    Revenant what the tattoo shifted to and the number of deaths so far. If the
    Revenant discovers a new land, they will be able to explore it. Over time,
    as new locations are discovered and charted, the Revenant will be able to
    upgrade their ship, hire more crew, purchase and commission new ships and
    fleets, establish trade routes, and assist in the colonization of new lands.
