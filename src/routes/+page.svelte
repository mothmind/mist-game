  <h1>Welcome, Revenant</h1>
  <p>
    This is the concept page of a videogame. In this game, the player takes the
    place of a Revenant Mariner, a dedicated explorer sailing through a deadly
    ocean to discover new lands. It's meant to be a sort of Uncharted Waters
    clone, but without the manual tile-based navigation.

  <h2>Aetherhaven</h2>

  <p>
    Aetherhaven, your home. Surrounded by a sea cloaked in perpetual mist, this
    city is a beacon of advanced magical technologies and towering multicolored
    skyscrapers. It pulses with the energy of arcing lightning and the hum of
    arcane innovations, attracting adventurers, scholars, and mystics from all
    corners of the world.
  </p>

  <h2>Drifter</h2>

  <p>
    The Drifter is a ship that the player uses to navigate the ocean. It's a
    small, cheap ship that the player will want to replace as soon as possible,
    but an upgraded ship will require more influence and crew to maintain.

  <h2>Revenant Mariner</h2>

  <p>
    You, the player. The player navigates this world with the aid of a
    Revenant's Mark, a powerful magical tattoo that transports the wearer back
    in time any time they die. Revenant Mariners chart and navigate The Lost
    Haze by repeatedly dying and returning to the past. When the tattoo is
    activated, the tattoo is updated with the cause of the Revenant's death, as
    well as the last known direction the Revenant had set off in, and an updated
    count of the number of times the tattoo has triggered.
  </p>

  <h2>The Lost Haze</h2>
  <img
    src="/lost-haze.webp"
    alt="A vast and deadly ocean filled with monsters and storms"
  />
  <p>
    The Lost Haze is a vast and deadly ocean filled with monsters, storms, and
    other dangers. The player must navigate this ocean to discover new lands and
    treasures, but the ocean is filled with dangers that can easily kill the
    player. The player must use their wits and their ship to survive the dangers
    of The Lost Haze and make it to the other side.
